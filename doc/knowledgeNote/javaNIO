DMA copy -Direct Memory Access 

BDP= Bandwidth * RTT
BDP:Bandwidth-delay product
RTT:Real-time Timer

Direct Buffer
1.It is therefore recommended that direct buffers be allocated primarily for large, long-lived buffers that are subject to the underlying system's native I/O operations. 
	In general it is best to allocate direct buffers only when they yield a measureable gain in program performance.
2.A direct byte buffer may also be created by mapping a region of a file directly into memory.

Internet Protocol is designed for use in interconnected systems of packet-switched computer communication networks'.
ARP -Address resolution protocol
RARP -Reverse address resolution protocol
ICMP -Internet control message protocol
BOOTP -bottstrap protocol
IGMP -Internet group management protocol
UDP -User datagram protocol
TCP -Transmission control protocol 

IP consists of 
	1. An addressing system for hosts
	2. The IP packet format definition
	3. The protocol proper-the rules about transmitting and receiving packetes
NIC -Network interface controller

TCP provides reliable bidirectional streaming connection between pairs of endpoint
By streaming means data transmitted and received is treated as a continuous stream of bytes,without message boundaries.
There are two kinds of TCP socket: 'active' and 'passive(more usually known as lisstening)'
Server: create passive TCP socket 	-> binds it to port 		-> put into listening state 		-> loops accepting client connections
Client: create active TCP socket 	-> connect to server port 	-> server accepts connect request 	-> server and client connected, reliably send each other any amount of data.

TCP data receptions are automatically acknowledged, sequenced, and resent as necessary.
TCP without saturating the network
TCP rapidly and reliably adjusts to changing network conditions
TCP implements a 'negotiated connect' to ensure server is up and running.
TCP implement a 'negotiated close' to ensure all data in flight is transmitted and received before the connection is dropped.

TCP Costs
SYNchronize
ACKnowledge
1.Connection negotiation consists of three-way exchange of packets. SYN(client)-ACK(server)-ACK(client)
	client send a SYN -> server responds a SYN/ACK -> client responds ACK   
	The total time spent trying to connect often limited to 75 seconds or three retries. 
	typical time for completely unsuccessful connection attempt might be 6+12+24=42 seconds.
2.Close negotiation consists of a four-way exchange of packets. FIN-ACK&FIN-ACK

Socket I/O
Output
1.TCP socket synchronous when local send buffer is concerned
2.TCP socket asynchronous when network and rmote application are concerned.
3.Always create an ObjectOutputStream before an ObjectInputStream for the same socket.

Input
1.It is best to attach a BufferedInputStream to the input stream, The buffer should be at least as large as socket receive buffer
  This minimises context switch into the kernel and drains the socket receive buffer more quickly,
  which in turn reduces stalling at the sender,Also minimizes switching back and forth between the JVM and JNI.    
By contrast Socket.close is completely asynchronous by default. 

Socke timeout
1.Default delay is two hours before the dead connection is detected
2.Time-out might be set to twice the sum of the expected time

Socket Buffers
1.The default size of these buffer is determined by the underlying platform's implementation of TCP.
2.Origin TCP implementation send and receive buffer size both 2KB,Now the default size 28,32,64KB. 
	8KB(WINSOCK) 28KB(OS/2) 52KB(Solaris)
3.The method in socket set send and receive buffer only act as a hint to the underlying platform.
4.Socket buffer sizes should be at lest three times the size of the MSS for the connection
	MSS=MTU+40(TCP/IP header)
	MSS:Maximum segment size
	MTU:Maximum transmission unit
5.Send buffer size should be at least as big as the receive buffer.
6.Maximum throughput of a single TCP connection is limited at any one time to W/(RTT) 
	W is current receive window, whose maximum possible size if the receive buffer size
	RTT is round-trip time over the connection for a packet and its acknowledgement
7.The optimum size of a send buffer on two factors: bandwidth or the time for a packet to make a round-trip between endpoints
	capacity(bits)=bandwidth(bits/sec)*delay(sec)
Nagle's algorithm
It deter TCP from sending a sequence of small segments in circumstances when the data is being injected slowly. 
By default Nagle's algorithm is enable, but can disenable setTcpNodelay(true).
