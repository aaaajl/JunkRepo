A Web service is a method of communication between two electronic devices over the web (internet).
The W3C defines a "Web service" as "a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network".
We can identify two major classes of Web services, 
REST-compliant Web services,in which the primary purpose of the service is to manipulate XML representations of Web resources using a uniform set of "stateless" operations
arbitrary Web services, in which the service may expose an arbitrary set of operations.
