Protocol Guarantees
1)Sequential Consistency 
	- Updates from a client will be applied in the order that they were sent.
2) Atomicity 
	- Updates either succeed or fail. No partial results.
3) Single System Image 
	- A client will see the same view of the service regardless of the server that it connects to. 
4) Reliability 
	- Once an update has been applied, it will persist from that time forward until a client overwrites the update.
5) Timeliness 
	- The clients view of the system is guaranteed to be up-to-date within a certain bound.
	Either system changes will be seen by a client within this bound, or the client will detect a service outage.

Servers
1)All servers store a copy of the data
2)A leader is elected at startup
3)Followers service clients, all updates go through leader
4)Update responses are sent when a majority of servers have persisted the change

Leading
1)Leader does not lead until a quorum of followers have synced with it.
2)Zxid is a 64-bit number: 32-bit of epoch and 32-bit counter.
3)The first proposal from a leader is a NEWLEADER txn that has a zxid with the epoch bits one greater than the last logged zxid and the counter set to zero.
4)Leader accepts requests after a quorum have acked the NEWLEADER txn.
5)Everything processed in order.

DataTree
1)DataNodes contain node data, stat, and child list
2)Hashtable maps path to DataNode
3)Updates logged to stable storage
4)Rough snapshots taken periodically
