Design Principle

Five principle of class design
1.SRP Single Responsibility Principle

2.OCP Open Closed Principle
3.LSP Liskov Substitution Principle
4.ISP Interface Segregation Principle
5.DIP Dependency Inversion Principle

Three principles of package cohesion
1.REP Reuse Release Equivalence Principle
2.CCP Common Closure Principle
3.CRP Common Reuse Principle

Three principle of package coupling
1.ADP Acyclic Dependencies Principle
2.SDP Stable Dependencies Principle
3.SAP Stable Abstractions Principle

Design Pattern

Singleton: Ensure that only one instance of a class is created and provide a global access point to the object.
