CAP - Consistency, Availability and Partition-Tolerant
Consistency. Think database consistency. A read after an update should reflect the update.

Availability. Highly available web services mean every requests should succeed and receive a response.

Partition-tolerance. This arise out of the desire for fault-tolerance. The service should be able to function when part of
network fails, when a partition between data replicas will still allow the service to operate.

Amazon's S3 guarantees availability and partition-tolerance but does
not guarantee consistency.Amazon describes this as eventually consistent model.
